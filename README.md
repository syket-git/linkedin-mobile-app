# LinkedIn Mobile App

As a part of my continuous learning journey, I undertook the challenge of creating a clone of the LinkedIn Mobile app UI. This project allowed me to hone my layout design skills and strengthen my ability to craft intricate design layouts. Throughout the development process, I gained invaluable insights and expanded my knowledge in several areas.

One significant learning experience was mastering the effective use of FlatList, which enabled me to build smooth and performant scrolling experiences within the app. Additionally, I delved into optimizing image assets and leveraging Expo Router, ensuring efficient resource management and seamless navigation.

 I utilized a powerful technology stack comprising React Native, Expo, NativeWind, and Expo Router. These cutting-edge tools empowered me to create a visually stunning and responsive user interface while adhering to industry best practices.
 
Overall, this endeavor not only showcased my proficiency in layout design but also allowed me to expand my skillset in areas such as performance optimization, resource management, and leveraging modern frameworks and libraries. I am excited to continue exploring new challenges and further refining my expertise in mobile app development.
